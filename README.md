Due to legal issues, we cannot redistribute the debate recording.
However, the debate is publicly available online at YouTube: https://youtu.be/Hybsgj1MIZ4

The debate is segmented into turns, where each turn consists of a politician talking without a major interruption by the other politician or one of the journalists.
Small interruptions can occur though.
So, the first step for preprocessing the debate video file is to segment it in turns.
